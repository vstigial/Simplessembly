 We start by defining _start as a global,
 then we begin the body of the label
);

global(_start);

	We define a string variable with the size of a byte using db
	We then set the name of the variable to 'hello'
	Finally, we set the value of the variable to "Hello, World!\n"
);
	str_var(db, hello, "Hello, World!\n");

	We then write the value of the variable into stdout
	The first argument is the variable we want to write,
	and the second is the length that we want to write
);
	write(hello, 15);

	'exit' takes one argument, the exitcode, and is required to ensure your program exits correctly
);
	exit(0);
